Inspired by the Ancient Greek games, the modern-day Olympics began in 1896, ceremoniously hosted in Athens, Greece. Governed by the International Olympics Committee (founded in 1894), the modern Olympics Games have grown and evolved tremendously over the past 124, subject to cultural, political, and social influence from international participants across the world. An epicenter of both global cooperation and conflict, the Olympic Games reflect and inform the state of our international relationships. From doping to boycotts, terrorism to treaties, the Olympic Games has faced its fair share of obstacles throughout its history. Starting with a mere 12 nations in 1896, the summer Olympic Games now host over 200 countries every four years. Introduced in 1924, the winter Olympic Games increased the size of the Olympic program tremendously, but eventually split from the summer games in 1992. Now, each set of games alternates in occurrence, hosted every four years, but two years apart in that cycle. Additional changes have occurred as a result of the political, economic, and technological growth of our society, allowing the Olympic Games to become a catalyst for social change and human rights movements. Throughout this process, athletes from across the world, now representing nearly every nation, have the opportunity to represent their homeland. Additionally, host countries gain the opportunity to boast their status by showcasing their city to the rest of the world.

In this project, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the modern Olympic Games from 1896 until the present, using data from each participant with the following features:

    * Name
    * Sex
    * Age
    * Height
    * Weight
    * Team
    * NOC
    * Games
    * Year
    * Season
    * City
    * Sport
    * Event
    * Medal
    
Through this analysis, our goal will be to reveal insights about the Olympic Games, particularly with regards to changes over time, differences between types of athletes, and the ways in which the games inform our international relations.
